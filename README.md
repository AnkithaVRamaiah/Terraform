# Terraform
Terraform is a tool that helps create and manage infrastructure using code. It utilizes the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) for defining infrastructure as code.

# By learning HCL
you can work with any cloud platform using Terraform, eliminating the need to learn specific templating tools for each cloud provider.

# Different cloud providers offer their own infrastructure templating languages:
• AWS provides CloudFormation Templates (CFT).
• Azure uses Resource Manager templates (ARM templates).
• OpenStack offers Heat templates.

# Common Terraform Commands:
• terraform init - Initializes the configuration and sets up the backend for storing the state.
• terraform plan - Performs a dry run to show what changes Terraform will make.
• terraform apply - Applies the changes defined in the Terraform files to create or update resources.
• terraform destroy - Destroys all resources that were created by Terraform.
